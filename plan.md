- Updated UserSerializer in properties app to match custom User model (remove 'username' field, use 'email')
- Updated UserSerializer in properties app to match custom User model (remove 'username' field, use 'email')
- Investigating dashboard redirection issue after admin login on frontend; login redirects to /dashboard but dashboard content does not appear as expected.
- Determined that Dashboard.jsx currently uses mock user data and is not connected to backend authentication or user info; dashboard does not reflect actual logged-in user state. Need to connect login form to backend API and pass real user data to dashboard for proper admin/user experience.
- Currently blocked: After login, frontend fails to fetch user data from backend ("Failed to fetch user data"). Need to debug user endpoint, permissions, or serialization in accounts app.
- Added CurrentUserView to backend and exposed /api/v1/auth/users/me/ endpoint in accounts.urls to resolve user data fetch issue after login.

- Improved error handling and data validation implemented in Properties and Hotels pages to prevent runtime errors from undefined/null values and unexpected API responses.
- Both Properties and Hotels pages now fetch data from backend API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is displayed.
- [CRITICAL] Blocking authentication bug: Frontend receives 403 Forbidden and "Authentication credentials were not provided" when accessing protected endpoints (e.g. /auth/users/me/), indicating missing or invalid token handling in login and user fetch flows. Need to debug and resolve frontend-backend authentication integration.
- Authentication flow and token refresh logic in frontend improved: API interceptor now robustly attempts token refresh on 401 errors, and AuthContext fetches user data with explicit Authorization header. Syntax errors in AuthContext fixed. Next: verify login, token persistence, and user info fetch end-to-end.
- Received and reviewed the Shiats3 Internal Guide: all future backend, frontend, and UI/UX work must align with the project's branding (African hut logo, color palette, fonts), user roles, features, and quality standards as outlined. Ensure all new features, admin/agent/hotel manager dashboards, and content templates follow these guidelines.
